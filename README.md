# SAPcodeunnatiprog - NumPy

## Overview
NumPy is a powerful Python library for numerical computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning applications.


## Installation
You can install NumPy using pip
> pip install numpy

Copy code
> import numpy as np
Now you can start working with NumPy arrays and functions.

## Features
- **Arrays**: NumPy provides ndarray, a fast and flexible container for large datasets.
- **Mathematical Functions**: NumPy includes a wide range of mathematical functions such as trigonometric, exponential, and statistical functions.
- **Array Operations**: NumPy allows for efficient element-wise operations, broadcasting, slicing, and reshaping of arrays.
- **Linear Algebra**: NumPy provides functions for linear algebra operations such as matrix multiplication, eigenvalues, and decompositions.
- **Random Number Generation**: NumPy includes functions for generating random numbers from various probability distributions.
